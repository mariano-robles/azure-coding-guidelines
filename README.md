# Microsoft Azure Coding Guidelines and Style Guide

This set of style guides and coding guidelines outline the conventions that the Microsoft Azure Developer Experience Team tries to use with its open source cloud SDKs.

We welcome your feedback in [issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-coding-guidelines/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-coding-guidelines/pulls) and we'd love to hear from you on [Twitter](http://sazure.github.io/contact.html). Please take a look at our [contribution guidelines](http://azure.github.io/guidelines.html) before submitting a pull request.

Special thanks to [our contributors](https://github.com/Azure/azure-coding-guidelines/contributors) and the inspiration of others, including the New York Times, who have openly shared their guidelines as well.
